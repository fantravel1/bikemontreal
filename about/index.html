    <h2>What is BikeMontreal?</h2>

    <p>BikeMontreal is not a booking site. It's not a travel app. It's not sponsored tourism propaganda. It's a guide written by people who actually bike Montréal, who know the neighborhoods intimately, who have ridden every route described here.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: var(--space-4);">We believe the best way to experience Montréal is on a bike. Not in a tour bus. Not from a car window. On two wheels, moving at human speed, stopping when something appeals to you.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: var(--space-4);">This guide shows you how to see Montréal the way Montrealers see it. The routes locals ride. The neighborhoods where locals actually live. The cafés where locals sit. Not tourist versions of these things — the real versions.</p>

    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>

    <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-5);">We're Honest</h3>
    <p>We don't sugarcoat. A neighborhood is working-class and gritty? We say that. A route is crowded on weekends? We tell you. A climb is hard? You'll read it here. Honesty matters more than marketing.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-5);">We're Detailed</h3>
    <p>Vague directions are useless. Every route includes turn-by-turn details. Every neighborhood describes what you'll actually see, where you'll actually eat, what the vibe is actually like.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-5);">We're Inclusive</h3>
    <p>Biking isn't just for athletes. We have guides for kids, for beginners, for budget travelers, for people new to the city. Everyone can bike Montréal. We show you how.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-5);">We're Local-Focused</h3>
    <p>This isn't a guide for tourists, though tourists are welcome. This is a guide for experiencing Montréal the way locals experience it. Local cafés, local neighborhoods, local culture.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-5);">We Ride Everything</h3>
    <p>Every route in this guide has been ridden. Every neighborhood has been explored. Every café has been visited. This isn't armchair travel writing. It's field-tested knowledge.</p>

    <h2>Why Bike?</h2>

    <p><strong>You Move at Human Speed</strong> — Cars rush. Transit stops only at stations. Biking lets you move at a pace that's fast enough to cover distance but slow enough to notice things. You see Montréal.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: var(--space-4);"><strong>You're Part of the City</strong> — You interact with the street. You talk to other cyclists. You stop at cafés. You're part of what happens. Not separate from it in a vehicle.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: var(--space-4);"><strong>You Experience Neighborhoods</strong> — You don't drive through a neighborhood. You ride through it. You stop. You look around. You understand what it actually is.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: var(--space-4);"><strong>It's Accessible</strong> — You don't need training or equipment. A bike, a helmet, and these guides. That's it. Anyone can do this.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: var(--space-4);"><strong>You Remember It</strong> — The routes you ride, the cafés you stop at, the neighborhoods you explore. These become your Montréal. Your memories. Your city.</p>

    <h2>The Montréal We Describe</h2>

    <p>This isn't the Montréal of postcards. It's the Montréal of real neighborhoods, real food, real people.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: var(--space-4);">It's the quiet of early morning on Parc La Fontaine. It's the art of Griffintown's streets. It's the Vietnamese pho in Rosemont that costs $7 and is genuinely great. It's the old brick buildings of Plateau. It's the forest silence of Île-Bizard. It's the waterfront at sunset. It's kids playing in neighborhood parks. It's the real culture, real pace, real life.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: var(--space-4);">This is the Montréal we bike through every day. This is what we want to share.</p>
