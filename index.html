Tourists can purchase a single ride ($1 to unlock + $0.10/min), a day pass, or a 3-day pass. Download the BIXI app, pick up a bike at any station, ride to your destination, and dock it at the nearest station. E-bikes are also available at a slightly higher rate. BIXI operates from April through November. For the best experience, plan rides under 30 minutes between stations to keep costs low."

It covers about 25 km on mostly protected paths and includes café stops, parks, and iconic viewpoints. We also offer themed itineraries: Romantic, Foodie, Family, and Sunset."

Summer (June-August) is peak season with festivals and long daylight. Fall (September-October) offers the best riding: cool air, fewer crowds, and spectacular autumn colors. Winter biking (November-March) is for the adventurous — some protected paths are maintained, but BIXI shuts down and you'll need proper cold-weather gear. The city clears priority bike lanes like the REV throughout winter."

Bikes are allowed on the Metro during off-peak hours (weekdays before 7am, 10am-3pm, after 7pm, and all day on weekends). The best strategy is to Metro to a starting point like Jean-Drapeau or Lionel-Groulx, bike through scenic neighborhoods, and Metro back when you're tired. BIXI makes this even easier — pick up a bike at one station, ride across the city, dock it, and Metro home."

        <p>These routes are fully separated from car traffic with physical barriers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lachine Canal path — completely car-free</li>
          <li>REV on Saint-Denis and Bellechasse — bollard-separated</li>
          <li>De Maisonneuve protected corridor — one of the longest in North America</li>

      <div class="safety__card reveal reveal-delay-1">
        <div class="safety__card-icon">&#x26A0;</div>
        <h3>Intersections to Watch</h3>
        <p>Most of Montréal is bike-friendly, but these spots require extra attention:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Saint-Laurent &amp; de Maisonneuve — busy crossing, watch for turning cars</li>
          <li>Parc Ave near Mount Royal — merging traffic can be aggressive</li>
          <li>Old Montréal cobblestones — slow down, they're slippery when wet</li>
          <li>Any construction zone — Montréal is always building something</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="safety__card reveal">
        <div class="safety__card-icon">&#x1F6B4;</div>
        <h3>Local Riding Etiquette</h3>
        <p>How Montréalers ride — and how you should too:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Signal your turns (arm out) — it's standard practice</li>
          <li>Pass on the left, announce with "on your left" or a bell</li>
          <li>Helmets aren't legally required for adults, but strongly recommended</li>
          <li>Respect pedestrians on shared paths — slow down near parks</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="safety__card reveal reveal-delay-1">
        <div class="safety__card-icon">&#x1F512;</div>
        <h3>Bike Theft Prevention</h3>
        <p>Bike theft is real in Montréal. Protect yourself:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a U-lock (cable locks are easily cut)</li>
          <li>Lock through the frame AND wheel to a fixed object</li>
          <li>Don't leave bikes locked outside overnight in busy areas</li>
          <li>BIXI eliminates theft risk entirely — dock it and walk away</li>

            Montréal is one of the best biking cities in North America. With over 900 km of bike paths, a world-class bike-share system (BIXI), protected lanes in nearly every neighborhood, and a culture that treats cycling as transportation rather than sport, Montréal is a city that truly thinks in bikes. From the Lachine Canal path to the leafy streets of the Plateau, biking is how locals move, explore, and experience the city. Whether you're a first-time visitor or a seasoned cyclist, the infrastructure and culture make it easy and enjoyable.

            BIXI is Montréal's public bike-share system with over 10,000 bikes at 800+ stations. Download the BIXI app, create an account, and unlock a bike at any station by scanning the QR code. Pricing starts at $1 to unlock plus $0.10 per minute, with day passes ($7) and 3-day passes ($15) available. E-bikes cost slightly more. BIXI operates from April through November. Pro tip: plan short rides between stations (under 30 minutes) to keep costs low, and use the app to check station availability.

The Classic Montréal Bike Day covers about 25 km on mostly protected paths: start in Old Montréal, follow the Lachine Canal to Atwater Market for brunch, cut through the Plateau for bagels and coffee, climb to the Mount Royal lookout for sunset, and finish with dinner in Mile End. We also offer Romantic, Foodie, Family, Sunset, and Nature Escape variations — each with detailed routes, timing, and stop recommendations.

            Yes — Montréal is rideable in every season. Spring (April&ndash;May) brings warming temps but watch for potholes. Summer (June&ndash;August) is peak season with festivals and long daylight. Fall (September&ndash;October) is the best riding season: cool air, fewer crowds, and spectacular autumn colors. Winter (November&ndash;March) is for the adventurous — BIXI shuts down, but priority lanes like the REV are maintained year-round. You'll need proper gear and possibly studded tires, but winter cycling in Montréal is growing every year.

          What is BikeScore&trade; and how does it rank routes?

            BikeScore&trade; is BikeMontreal's proprietary rating system. Every route and neighborhood is evaluated on six factors: Protected Lane Quality (physical separation from cars), Traffic Stress (car speed, volume, intersection complexity), Scenery (water views, parks, architecture), Stop Density (cafés, parks, viewpoints), Safety (intersection design, lighting, sight lines), and Tourist Friendliness (navigation simplicity, BIXI access, signage). Scores range from 0&ndash;100, making it easy to find routes that match your comfort level and interests.

          Can I combine the Montréal Métro and biking in one day?

          <div class="faq__answer-inner">
            Combining the Métro and biking is one of the smartest ways to explore Montréal. Bikes are allowed on the Métro during off-peak hours (weekdays before 7am, 10am&ndash;3pm, and after 7pm; all day on weekends and holidays). The best strategy is to Métro to a starting station like Jean-Drapeau or Lionel-Groulx, bike through scenic neighborhoods, and Métro back when you're tired. BIXI makes this even easier — pick up a bike, ride, dock it, and take the Métro home without worrying about transport rules.
