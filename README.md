# BIKEMONTREAL.COM — README (v1)
**The ultimate biking city guide to Montréal.**  
**Montréal, by bike.**

BikeMontreal is not a generic tourism site.  
It is not a road-cycling spandex brand.  
It is not “biking as recreation.”

BikeMontreal treats biking as:

- transportation  
- culture  
- identity  
- urban exploration  

BikeMontreal exists to help people:

> **“See Montréal the way Montréal sees itself.”**

This README defines the **non-negotiable philosophy, scoring IP, architecture, templates, tone, safety standards, and scaling rules** for building BikeMontreal into a definitive city mega-site.

---

## 0) The Core Reframe (Non-Negotiable)

### Montréal is a bike city first.

BikeMontreal’s thesis:

Montréal is not a city where you can bike.  
Montréal is a city that **thinks in bikes**.

Biking is:
- how locals move  
- how neighborhoods connect  
- how the city reveals itself  
- how you experience culture  
- how you find food, parks, and festivals  

BikeMontreal’s job is not to list attractions.

BikeMontreal’s job is to map:
> **routes + rhythm + neighborhoods + stops**

---

## 1) What BikeMontreal Is (and Is Not)

### BikeMontreal IS:
- a route-first Montréal exploration engine  
- a neighborhood-by-neighborhood biking guide  
- the best BIXI explainer online  
- a cycling culture calendar  
- a food + bike city guide  
- a seasonal riding intelligence system  
- a safety-first, friendly local voice  

### BikeMontreal is NOT:
- a sports cycling training site  
- a Tour de France gear blog  
- a generic “top 10 things to do” site  
- a spandex culture brand  
- a government PDF republisher  

If the site feels like “exercise,” it’s wrong.

---

## 2) The Mega-Site Pillars (Non-Negotiable)

Everything must fall into one of these pillars.

### 🚲 A) Bike Routes (The SEO Engine)
Routes are the core unit.

### 🗺️ B) Neighborhood Bike Guides
Neighborhoods are the cultural layer.

### 🛠️ C) Bike Rentals & BIXI
Utility + onboarding + trust.

### 🏁 D) Events & Group Rides
Recurring content and community relevance.

### 🍩 E) Food + Bike Culture
Montréal’s secret weapon.

---

## 3) Signature IP: BikeScore™

BikeMontreal uses BikeScore™ to feel authoritative.

### BikeScore™ applies to:
- routes  
- neighborhoods  

BikeScore is shown everywhere.

---

## 4) BikeScore™ (Canonical Factors)

BikeScore must be consistent.

Every route and neighborhood is rated on:

- **Protected Lane Quality**
- **Traffic Stress**
- **Scenery**
- **Stop Density** (cafés, parks, viewpoints)
- **Safety**
- **Tourist Friendliness**

### Philosophy
- Protected lanes matter more than people admit.
- Stop density makes a ride feel like Montréal.
- A great bike city is about ease, not bravery.
